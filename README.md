## Deploy Large Language Models on Amazon EKS using vLLM Deep Learning Containers

In this tutorial, you will learn to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) 
using vLLM Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) 

! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¤—ðŸš€âœ¨

Organizations today face significant challenges when deploying LLMs efficiently at scale. These challenges include optimizing GPU resource utilization, managing network infrastructure, and providing efficient access to model weights. This tutorial addresses these challenges by leveraging AWS DLCs for vLLM, which provide pre-configured, optimized Docker environments that eliminate the complexity of building inference environments from scratch.

In this tutorial, you will build a scalable, high-performance inference system for serving models such as Qwen 2.5 0.5B Instruct 
using AWS-optimized containers and modern cloud-native technologies.
